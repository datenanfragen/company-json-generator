## :hash: What is the goal of this repository?
This repository contains the source code for the tool to generate valid JSON records for the Datenanfragen.de company database.

## :hash: What is [`Datenanfragen.de`](https://www.datenanfragen.de/)?
Datenanfragen.de is an open source project by [Datenanfragen.de e.&nbsp;V.](https://www.datarequests.org/verein), a registered non-profit from Germany. We have made it our mission to help you exercise your right to privacy. 

Through [our website](https://company-json.netlify.app/), we offer a generator for GDPR requests as well as access to our company and supervisory authority database (see [this repository](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/) for the source behind this data) and comprehensive articles on the GDPR and privacy in general.

## :hash: Details of Company JSON Generator
Every company (or other organization) in our database is represented by a single JSON file (named after the slug in the JSON). 

The JSON has to follow the specific schema. This tool provides you the convinience to generate those JSONs by filling a simple form. The format is explained [here](https://github.com/datenanfragen/data/#data-formats).
